# first value is called left
# second value is called right 
# if both integers, lower integer should come first
# if both values are lists, compare the first value of each list, then second and so on:
    # if leftlist runs out of items first, list is good. Same length = keep checking
# if one value is an integer, convert integer to list which contains that integer as its only value, then retry the comparison

Break it down into individual lists:
    Find first left bracket and last right bracket and continue to shrink and append to outer list 
    print(left.rindex("]")) --> last index

Take left bracket and bracket counter: if bracket counter > 1, next closed bracket will not close the current array

get the inner chunk and pop it out and return next chunk with same logic
